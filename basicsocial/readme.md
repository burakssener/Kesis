### Features
KESIS is a social media that allows you to create your own private communities to share posts and communicate with other members. You can also explore and discover new communities and topics that interest you.

### Technologies and Tools

Python: I used Python as the back-end programming language for creating the logic and functionality of the app. Python allowed me to write concise and readable code and use various libraries and modules for different tasks.

Flask: I used Flask as the web framework for creating the web server and handling the requests and responses. Flask provided me with a lightweight and flexible solution that integrated well with Python and other tools.
Jinja2: I used Jinja2 as the template engine for rendering the HTML pages and injecting the data from the back-end. Jinja2 enabled me to create dynamic and reusable templates and use control structures and filters for customizing the output.

SQLite3: I used SQLite3 as the database for storing and retrieving the data, such as the user information, the community information, the posts information, etc. SQLite3 offered me a simple and portable solution that worked well with Flask and Python.
HTML: I used HTML as the markup language for creating the structure and content of the web pages. HTML allowed me to define the elements and attributes of the web pages and use semantic tags for better accessibility and SEO.

CSS: I used CSS as the style sheet language for styling and formatting the web pages. CSS enabled me to apply colors, fonts, layouts, animations, and other effects to the web pages and make them more attractive and responsive.

Bootstrap: I used Bootstrap as the UI framework for designing and developing the user interface and user experience of the app. Bootstrap provided me with a set of pre-built components and classes that followed the best practices and standards of web design and development.
