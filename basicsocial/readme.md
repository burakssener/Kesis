SQLite3: I used SQLite3 as the database for storing and retrieving the data, such as the user information, the community information, the posts information, etc. SQLite3 offered me a simple and portable solution that worked well with Flask and Python.
HTML: I used HTML as the markup language for creating the structure and content of the web pages. HTML allowed me to define the elements and attributes of the web pages and use semantic tags for better accessibility and SEO.

CSS: I used CSS as the style sheet language for styling and formatting the web pages. CSS enabled me to apply colors, fonts, layouts, animations, and other effects to the web pages and make them more attractive and responsive.

Bootstrap: I used Bootstrap as the UI framework for designing and developing the user interface and user experience of the app. Bootstrap provided me with a set of pre-built components and classes that followed the best practices and standards of web design and development.
